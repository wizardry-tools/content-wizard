### Soft Release of basic Query abilities

- Query Wizard: Form-driven QueryBuilder statement builder
- Query IDE: Customized and extended GraphiQL IDE to support other Query Languages
- Results: Basic paginated Data Table for results display.

Note: this release has a package on Maven Central, but it isn't ideal. Technically still deployable/functional, but there are mistakes in the pom definitions.
