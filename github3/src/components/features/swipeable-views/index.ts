/**
 * This module contains a refactored version of React Swipeable Views.
 * https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views
 *
 * Refactored to work with React 18 and Typescript.
 * Some Features have been removed for my own sanity,
 * otherwise I would release it as a PR to the source.
 *
 * Copied from the Content Wizard Repo main branch.
 * All dev improvements need to be made there and copied here,
 * until this logic has been published as a NPM module.
